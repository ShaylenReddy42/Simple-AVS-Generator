### What is this project for? ###

This project was created to make my life easier.
It creates scripts to re-encode videos using AviSynth+, x264, x265, qaac64 and opusenc [with my preferred settings] and using mp4box or mkvmerge to mux the resulting files into a container.
This project currently assumes that all these tools are in your PATH and easily accessible

### How do I get set up? ###

You need to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition with C# language support and [CMake v3.8 or later](https://cmake.org) [This must be in your PATH]

### Build Instructions ###

Run build/Build [Project].cmd and the resulting executable will be in same folder as the script
